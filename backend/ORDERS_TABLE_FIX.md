# Orders Table Fix Documentation

## Issue
The application was showing the error:
```
API Error: Error fetching users: SQLSTATE[42S02]: Base table or view not found: 1146 Table 'agrilink.orders' doesn't exist
```

## Root Cause
The `orders` table was missing from the database. This table is required for the checkout and order management functionality.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created the Orders Table
Executed the SQL script `create_orders_table.sql` which:

- Creates the `orders` table with all necessary fields
- Sets up proper foreign key relationships with `customers`, `sellers`, and `products` tables
- Adds indexes for better query performance

### 2. Fixed Table Structure
Ran `fix_orders_table.php` to remove the `billing_city` column which was causing compatibility issues.

### 3. Verified the Fix
Created and ran test scripts to confirm:
- Table exists and is accessible
- Table structure is correct
- Foreign key constraints are working

## Files Created

1. `create_orders_table.php` - Script to create the orders table
2. `check_orders_table.php` - Script to verify table structure
3. `setup_database.php` - Comprehensive setup script for all tables
4. `test_orders_access.php` - Script to test table access

## Commands to Verify the Fix

```bash
# Check table structure
cd backend && php check_orders_table.php

# Test table access
cd backend && php test_orders_access.php

# Run comprehensive setup (if needed)
cd backend && php setup_database.php
```

## Expected Outcome
The error "Table 'agrilink.orders' doesn't exist" should no longer appear when accessing order-related functionality in the application.

## Additional Notes
- The orders table has foreign key constraints that require valid references to customers, sellers, and products
- These related tables must exist and have appropriate records for full functionality
- The fix only addresses the missing table issue, not data population
