    <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
      Cinnamon tea is a warm, aromatic beverage made by infusing cinnamon bark in hot water. 
      Prized for its sweet, spicy flavor and inviting aroma, cinnamon tea has been enjoyed for centuries 
      across many cultures, both as a comforting drink and for its potential health benefits. 
      Whether sipped on a chilly evening or served as a soothing remedy, cinnamon tea is known for its 
      ability to relax the senses and support overall wellness. 
      <br /><br />
      Cinnamon, perhaps one of the most popular and tastiest of spices used for sweet and savory recipes, 
      is actually the bark of a tree. The tree’s inner bark is stripped and dried until it curls into rolls or quills. 
      It’s available as sticks or ground powder.There are two main types of cinnamon: Ceylon cinnamon, often referred to as “true” cinnamon, and Cassia cinnamon, which is more common and usually found in supermarkets. Ceylon cinnamon is lighter in color and has a delicate, mildly sweet flavor, while Cassia is darker, thicker, and has a stronger, more pungent taste. Although both are used in cooking, Ceylon cinnamon is often preferred for its quality and lower coumarin content, making it safer in large quantities.

Historically, cinnamon has been prized since ancient times. It was once considered a gift fit for kings and gods, used in religious rituals, perfumes, and even for embalming in Egypt. In medieval Europe, it became a symbol of wealth and status and was one of the key drivers of the spice trade.

      There are mainly two types of cinnamon available in the market: Ceylon and Cassia. Ceylon cinnamon is known as “true” cinnamon and is native to Sri Lanka, whereas Cassia is more commonly found and cheaper. Ceylon cinnamon has a delicate, mildly sweet flavor and is preferred for its health benefits.Beyond its culinary uses, cinnamon is well-known for its medicinal properties. It is rich in antioxidants, has anti-inflammatory effects, and may help lower blood sugar levels. Some studies suggest it can reduce the risk of heart disease and improve insulin sensitivity, making it a favorite in traditional medicine systems like Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine.
