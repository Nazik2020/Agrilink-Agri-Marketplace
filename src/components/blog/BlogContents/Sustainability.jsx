        üåø Farming & Sustainability: How Ceylon Spices Support the Earth and Farmers
      </h1>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-900">üå± Introduction: A Greener Way to Grow</h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        In today's world of industrial agriculture, where chemical fertilizers and mass production dominate the landscape, 
        <strong> Sri Lanka's spice farming</strong> stands out as a <strong>sustainable and eco-conscious model</strong>. 
        The cultivation of <strong>Ceylon spices</strong> like cinnamon, pepper, clove, turmeric, and cardamom is deeply 
        intertwined with traditional farming knowledge, organic methods, and a respect for nature that has been passed down through generations.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        More than just aromatic ingredients, Ceylon spices represent a <strong>way of farming that supports the earth and empowers rural communities</strong>. 
        It's about balance‚Äîbetween nature and agriculture, between economy and ecology.

      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-900">ü™¥ 1. Organic and Low-Impact Farming</h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        Many Ceylon spice farmers avoid synthetic chemicals, choosing <strong>organic practices</strong> that preserve soil health and biodiversity. 
        Instead of relying on chemical pesticides or fertilizers, they use natural compost, mulch, and age-old farming techniques that keep the environment thriving.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-md font-semibold mb-1 text-gray-900">Key Benefits:</h4>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-gray-800">
        <li>Prevents soil erosion and degradation</li>
        <li>Protects groundwater from contamination</li>
        <li>Maintains natural ecosystems for birds, bees, and beneficial insects</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        This method of cultivation results in <strong>spices that are richer in essential oils and flavor</strong>, 
        while also keeping farming sustainable for future generations.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-900">üå≥ 2. Agroforestry: Spices Grown Under the Forest Canopy</h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        Sri Lankan spice farms often operate as <strong>agroforests</strong>‚Äîa system where spices grow alongside coconut, jackfruit, betel, and banana trees. 
        This practice mimics natural ecosystems and provides both ecological and economic benefits.
      </p>
      <img 
        src={sus2} 
        alt="Agroforestry spice farming" 
        className="mb-4 rounded-lg" 
        style={{ height: "220px", width: "auto" }}
        onError={(e) => console.error("Error loading sus2:", e)}
        onLoad={() => console.log("sus2 loaded successfully")}
      />

      <h4 className="text-md font-semibold mb-1 text-gray-900">Advantages of Agroforestry:</h4>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-gray-800">
        <li>Shade-grown spices like <strong>pepper and cardamom</strong> thrive under trees</li>
        <li>Reduces carbon footprint by sequestering carbon in trees and soil</li>
        <li>Promotes biodiversity and natural pest control</li>
        <li>Farmers gain additional income from multiple crops</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        This "multi-layered farming" approach helps spice farmers <strong>resist the risks of monoculture</strong> and climate-related crop failure.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-900">üßë‚Äçüåæ 3. Empowering Smallholder Farmers</h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        In Sri Lanka, the majority of spice cultivation is done by <strong>smallholder farmers</strong>, not large corporations. 
        These farmers often work family-owned plots of land and depend on traditional wisdom to manage their crops.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-md font-semibold mb-1 text-gray-900">How Sustainable Spice Farming Helps:</h4>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-gray-800">
        <li>Provides stable, long-term income through ethical trade</li>
        <li>Encourages <strong>community-based farming cooperatives</strong></li>
        <li>Promotes knowledge sharing between generations</li>
        <li>Ensures local ownership and care for the land</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        With growing global demand for ethically produced spices, many farmers are now <strong>Fair Trade certified</strong>, 
        ensuring that their work is valued and their prices are fair.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-900">üåæ 4. Climate-Resilient Farming Practices</h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        Sri Lanka, like many tropical countries, faces climate challenges such as irregular rainfall and rising temperatures. 
        Spice farmers are adapting by:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-gray-800">
        <li>Planting <strong>drought-resistant spice varieties</strong></li>
        <li>Using <strong>rainwater harvesting systems</strong></li>
        <li>Practicing <strong>crop rotation</strong> and <strong>intercropping</strong> to restore soil health</li>
        <li>Transitioning to <strong>regenerative agriculture</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        These practices make spice farming more <strong>resilient to climate change</strong>, while also reducing environmental damage.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-900">‚ôªÔ∏è 5. A Global Shift Toward Sustainable Spices</h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        Conscious consumers and companies around the world are increasingly demanding products that are 
        <strong>sustainably and ethically sourced</strong>. Ceylon spices meet this demand not just in quality, but in <strong>planet-friendly farming</strong>.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">Look for certifications like:</p>
