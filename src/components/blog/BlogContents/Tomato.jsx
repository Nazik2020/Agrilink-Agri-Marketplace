        🍅 The Power of Organic Tomatoes: A Healthier Harvest for You and the Planet
      </h1>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-900">🌿 Introduction: More Than Just a Salad Ingredient</h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        Tomatoes are a staple in kitchens across the world. From curries and sauces to salads and juices, their vibrant color and sweet-tangy flavor make them a must-have in nearly every cuisine. But not all tomatoes are grown the same. <strong>Organic tomatoes</strong>, cultivated without synthetic pesticides or fertilizers, are not only better for your health—they're a <strong>win for the planet, the soil, and the farmers</strong> too.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        In recent years, the demand for organic tomatoes has surged as consumers become more aware of where their food comes from and how it's grown. But what exactly sets <strong>organic tomato farming</strong> apart? And why should it matter to you?
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        Let's dig deep into the roots of organic tomato farming and discover why this humble fruit (yes, tomato is a fruit!) is leading a quiet revolution in sustainable agriculture.
      </p>
      
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-900">🌱 What Makes a Tomato "Organic"?</h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        To be labeled <strong>organic</strong>, a tomato must be grown under specific conditions:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-gray-800">
        <li><strong>No synthetic fertilizers or pesticides</strong></li>
        <li><strong>No genetically modified organisms (GMOs)</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Grown in living, nutrient-rich soil</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Supportive of biodiversity and eco-balance</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        Instead of chemicals, organic farmers use natural compost, neem oil, biological pest control, and crop rotation to maintain plant health and soil fertility. These practices not only result in <strong>healthier plants</strong>, but also in <strong>stronger ecosystems</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-900">🌞 The Farming Process: From Seed to Harvest</h3>
      
      <h4 className="text-md font-semibold mb-1 text-gray-900">1. Soil Preparation</h4>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        Healthy tomatoes begin with <strong>living soil</strong>. Organic farmers enrich the soil with compost, cow dung, green manure, and bio-fertilizers like <strong>vermicompost</strong> or <strong>panchagavya</strong>.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-md font-semibold mb-1 text-gray-900">2. Seed Selection</h4>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        Only <strong>non-GMO, heirloom, or open-pollinated seeds</strong> are used in organic farming. These seeds are naturally adapted to local climates and are often more resistant to diseases.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-md font-semibold mb-1 text-gray-900">3. Planting & Spacing</h4>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        Tomato seedlings are usually planted with adequate spacing (30–60 cm apart) to ensure proper airflow and reduce the chance of fungal disease.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-md font-semibold mb-1 text-gray-900">4. Natural Pest Management</h4>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">Instead of synthetic sprays, organic farmers use:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-gray-800">
        <li>Neem oil or garlic-chili spray for insects</li>
        <li>Marigold or basil as companion plants to repel pests</li>
        <li>Pheromone traps to control fruit borers</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 className="text-md font-semibold mb-1 text-gray-900">5. Irrigation</h4>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        Drip irrigation is commonly used to <strong>reduce water usage</strong> and prevent fungal problems. It also avoids water splashing on leaves, which can spread disease.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-md font-semibold mb-1 text-gray-900">6. Harvesting</h4>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        Tomatoes are handpicked at the perfect stage—firm but fully colored. Organic tomatoes are often smaller but <strong>richer in taste, aroma, and nutrients</strong>.

      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-900">🧪 Health Benefits of Organic Tomatoes</h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">Numerous studies show that <strong>organic tomatoes</strong>:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-gray-800">
        <li>Contain <strong>higher levels of antioxidants</strong> (like lycopene and vitamin C)</li>
        <li>Have <strong>fewer pesticide residues</strong></li>
        <li>Are richer in <strong>natural sugars and phytonutrients</strong></li>
        <li>Reduce exposure to harmful chemicals, especially for children</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        Organic tomatoes also <strong>ripen naturally</strong>, unlike conventional tomatoes that are sometimes gas-ripened with ethylene.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-900">🌍 Why Organic Tomatoes Are Better for the Environment</h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        Organic tomato farming goes beyond just avoiding chemicals—it actively helps <strong>regenerate the land</strong> and <strong>restore natural systems</strong>.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-md font-semibold mb-1 text-gray-900">🌾 Environmental Advantages:</h4>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-gray-800">
        <li><strong>Protects pollinators</strong> like bees and butterflies</li>
        <li><strong>Preserves soil health</strong> by encouraging beneficial microbes</li>
        <li><strong>Reduces water pollution</strong> by avoiding runoff of chemical fertilizers</li>
        <li><strong>Improves carbon sequestration</strong> through healthy soil practices</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        Organic farms also tend to <strong>produce less greenhouse gas emissions</strong>, making them more climate-friendly.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-900">👨‍🌾 The Farmer's Perspective</h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        In countries like Sri Lanka, India, and others in Asia and Africa, <strong>smallholder farmers</strong> are switching to organic tomato farming due to:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-gray-800">
        <li>Lower input costs (no need to buy expensive chemicals)</li>
        <li>Higher market value (organic tomatoes fetch premium prices)</li>
        <li>Safer working conditions (no toxic sprays)</li>
        <li>Support from government and NGOs in the form of <strong>training, certification</strong>, and <strong>micro-financing</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-800">
        Transitioning to organic does take time, but with proper education and local adaptation, it leads to <strong>more sustainable livelihoods</strong> and <strong>long-term food security</strong>.
